Please don't edit files within the source-yaml folder. These files contain meta data, the scraper produces.

## Confidence
The confidence values shows how many automatic confirmations we have in our database. Usually for YAMLs containing an entry with >0 confidence no manually additions are needed. (Manual entries are always 0). In rare cases, we may have a wrong connection. Also if a tonie contains alternative content, it may have an audio-id of an 20*.yaml.
